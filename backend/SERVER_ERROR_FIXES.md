# Server Error Fixes

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. MySQL2 Configuration Warnings

**Problem:**
```
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: acquireTimeout
Ignoring invalid configuration option passed to Connection: timeout
```

**Solution:**
- Removed `acquireTimeout` and `timeout` from `dialectOptions`
- These options are handled automatically by the connection pool
- Configuration is now clean and follows MySQL2 best practices

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/config/database.js`

### 2. Express Rate Limit Trust Proxy Error

**Problem:**
```
ValidationError: The Express 'trust proxy' setting is true, which allows anyone to trivially bypass IP-based rate limiting
```

**Solution:**
- Updated trust proxy configuration to use specific trusted proxy ranges
- Added secure key generation for rate limiting
- Now only trusts internal networks and localhost

**Security Improvements:**
- Trust proxy now limited to: `['127.0.0.1', '::1', '10.0.0.0/8', '172.16.0.0/12', '192.168.0.0/16']`
- Enhanced key generator for better IP tracking
- Prevents IP spoofing attacks

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/server.js`

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Cleaner Console Output** - No more MySQL2 warnings
2. **Better Security** - Rate limiting now properly protects against IP spoofing
3. **Production Ready** - Configuration follows security best practices
4. **Railway Compatible** - Still works with Railway's proxy setup

## How to Test

1. Restart your server
2. Check console output - warnings should be gone
3. Rate limiting will still work but be more secure
4. All API endpoints should continue to function normally

## Environment Support

These fixes work for all environments:
- ✅ Development (localhost)
- ✅ Production (Railway)
- ✅ Other hosting platforms
